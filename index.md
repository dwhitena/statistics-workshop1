# Why Does a Data Scientist use Stats?

--

- **Conveyance** - It turns out that Statistics is the natural language for describing sets of data, experiments, justifying results, etc.  So, as it also turns out, a data scientist uses Statistics to *convey* information about his/her work or about data.  

- **Applicability** - Many models used by data scientists have an underpinning of statistical principles and assumptions.  Thus, a data scientist must understand statistics in order to determine *applicability* of models.

- **Inference** - Well, we are scientists (I think), and statistical processes allow us to *infer* conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data.

# How Might I Describe My Beautiful Data? 
## (i.e., Descriptive Statistics)

--

Let's say I have the following values in a column of a table or in an array:

	> 57, 18, 41, 37, 73, 80, 58, 9, ..., 19

How could I describe this data, in general?  Guesses?

--

## Code.

```js
// Scope A
var foo = 1;
var myFunction = function () {
  // Scope B
  var bar = 2;
};
console.log(foo) // 1
console.log(bar) // ReferenceError!
```
